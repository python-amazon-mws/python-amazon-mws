Installation
############

Currently, two versions of the package are available: an older **v0.8.x**,
available `on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mws/>`_; and the in-development **v1.0devXY**,
available `on GitHub <https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws>`_.

For new projects, we recommend using **v1.0devXY**, as it contains a more complete set
of API sections and operations. Note that this version is still pre-alpha, so some parts
of the package are subject to change as we slowly update from the original 0.8.x code.

Use ``pip`` to install 1.0devXY from GitHub off the ``develop`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws.git@develop#egg=mws
