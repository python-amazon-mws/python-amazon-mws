        **What happened**
        Tell us about the issue you've encountered. Please take some time to add as much detail as necessary for us to understand the context of the problem. Where relevant, please add code samples or full tracebacks to help illustrate the issue.

        Please *do not* post screenshots of code or error messages: text is easier for everyone to read and copy.

        **Expected behavior**
        Tell us what you wanted the code to do, in a broad sense. Understanding what you're trying to do can help us offer alternatives that might work.

        All data uploaded to a public repo can be scraped via GitHub's API within seconds. Accidentally posting your credentials in a traceback or code sample can result in unauthorized access to your Amazon seller account.
