# python-amazon-mws

python-amazon-mws is a Python connector to [Amazon Marketplace Web Services][2]
(or MWS). It provides a simple way to build and send requests to MWS,
allowing access to all that MWS can do from your Python application.

## Mostly inactive development

Time to maintain this project is limited at present, and the MWS service is being deprecated in favor of the newer Selling Partners API (SP-API).

If you require assistance with this package specifically, please feel free to open an issue. This project may be archived in the near future and development halted.

## Installation

Two versions are currently available:

- Installing `mws` from PyPI, you will have version **0.8.x**, which is built from our `master` branch.
  - This is a close match to the original package by czpython, with some small tweaks to add critical functionality.
  - Supports Python 2.7 and 3.4+.
- The updated **1.0devXY** version must be installed from this repo's `develop` branch.
  - This includes additional API coverage that may be missing in 0.8.x, as well as other new features.
  - Some methods have new or updated arguments compared to 0.8.x, and much of the original monolithic `mws` module has been broken down into separate components (such as the `mws.apis` collection of modules).
  - Supports Python 3.6+.

### Installing 0.8.x (PyPI)

> **Warning**: If you are using version 0.8.x in a production system, note that our eventual 1.0 release will be backwards-incompatible, and may break programs that depend on the 0.8.x version. We advise users pin their Pip-installed version in requirements as `mws~=0.8.9`.

Install the `mws` package using Pip:

```shell
pip install mws
```

Alternatively, you can install direct from this repo's `master` branch, like so:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws.git@master#egg=mws
```

### Installing 1.0.x-dev (GitHub)

Our `develop` version can be installed directly from the repo using:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/python-amazon-mws/python-amazon-mws.git@develop#egg=mws
```

Note that code may be updated at any time as development continues, so please use at your own risk.

## Quickstart

Export your API credentials as environment variables in your shell.

```shell
export MWS_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export MWS_ACCESS_KEY=...
export MWS_SECRET_KEY=...
```

Now you can experiment with the API from within an interactive Python shell e.g.

```python
>>> import mws, os
>>> orders_api = mws.Orders(
...     access_key=os.environ['MWS_ACCESS_KEY'],
...     secret_key=os.environ['MWS_SECRET_KEY'],
...     account_id=os.environ['MWS_ACCOUNT_ID'],
...     region='UK',   # defaults to 'US'
... )
>>> service_status = orders_api.get_service_status()
>>> service_status
<mws.mws.DictWrapper object at 0x1063a2160>
>>> service_status.original
'<?xml version="1.0"?>\n<GetServiceStatusResponse xmlns="https://mws.amazonservices.com/Orders/2013-09-01">\n  <GetServiceStatusResult>\n    <Status>GREEN</Status>\n    <Timestamp>2017-06-14T16:39:12.765Z</Timestamp>\n  </GetServiceStatusResult>\n  <ResponseMetadata>\n    <RequestId>affdec68-05d2-4bc5-a8a4-bb40f307dd6b</RequestId>\n  </ResponseMetadata>\n</
GetServiceStatusResponse>\n'
>>> service_status.parsed
{'value': '\n    ', 'Status': {'value': 'GREEN'}, 'Timestamp': {'value': '2017-06-14T16:39:12.765Z'}}
>>> service_status.response
<Response [200]>
```

## Development

To get started with development, first clone this repo, then install the package locally with extra dependencies:

```shell
# development tooling (Black, Flake8, Isort
pip install -e .[develop]
# documentation tools
pip install -e .[docs]
# both of the above
pip install -e .[develop,docs]
# or, just everything
pip install -e .[all]
```

### Using pre-commit framework

This project uses the [pre-commit framework][4]. This framework installs a Git pre-commit hook that runs scripts as detailed in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` on commits in your local clone of the repo. These hooks are used to ensure code quality when contributing to the project.

The `pre-commit` package should already be installed along with installing development requirements (above), but is "opt-in" by design. We highly encourage using it in your local environment. To do so, install the hooks with:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit hook scripts will only run against the files that you change within a commit for speed purposes. To run the hooks against all files in the project, use:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Tests

Tests are run with `pytest`. To run tests, simply install our dev requirements and then run:

```shell
pytest
```

See [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests)
for details on selecting specific tests, rather than the entire test suite, as needed.

We also perform coverage reporting using `pytest-cov`. You can generate a coverage report locally using:

```shell
pytest --cov=mws
```

You may also want to generate a local HTML report to navigate the code and see where coverage is missing:

```shell
pytest --cov=mws --cov-report html
```

This will create a `htmlcov/` directory, and you can open `htmlcov/index.html` to view the report in your browser.

The test suite and coverage reporting to Codecov are run automatically in the repo on pushes and pull requests, using GitHub Actions workflows. We test on latest versions of Python 3.5+, and on latest Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows OSes.

### Documentation

Docs are built using Sphinx.

To build docs locally, use `make`:

```shell
make html
```

The output HTML documentation will be in `docs/build/`.

To run a live reloading server serving the HTML documentation (on `localhost:8000` or `127.0.0.1:8000` by default):

```shell
make livehtml
```

#### On Windows

`make` may not be available on Windows, but you can still build documentation with `sphinx-build` and `sphinx-autobuild`.

To build the docs locally, use `sphinx-build`:

```shell
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```

You can also run a live-reloading server using `sphinx-autobuild` (on `localhost:8000` or `127.0.0.1:8000` by default):

```shell
sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build
```

### Contributing

Please make pull requests to `develop`. Code coverage isn't necessary but encouraged where possible.

## Support
